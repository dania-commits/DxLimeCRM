# Lime Go – Product Manager Lab

Hi, I am Dania and this is a personalised case project I created specifically for the **Product Manager role at Lime Go**.

Rather than only sending a CV, I wanted to show how I think when I read your job description: owning outcomes, balancing discovery and delivery, and turning customer insight into product decisions that matter.

## 🎯 Concept – Lead Intelligence as a Product Theme

The core idea behind this mini-project is simple:

> Many SMB sales teams know that some leads are better than others, but their daily tools do not always make it obvious who to focus on first.

The **Lime Go – Product Manager Lab** explores how I would:
- understand that problem from different personas
- connect it to Lime Go’s sales CRM reality
- frame it as a product opportunity
- model impact
- and prioritise initiatives in a way that fits a scaleup context.

This is not trying to be a full product, but a **transparent window into my thinking**.

## 🧩 What the demo contains

The project is a single-page interactive web app with six sections:

### 1. Customer Lens – Personas & Jobs-to-be-done

A small module with three personas:

- Sales Manager at a growing SMB  
- Account Executive with a busy pipeline  
- Founder / CEO of an early-stage company  

Each persona shows:

- Jobs to be done  
- Pain points today  
- Where Lime Go can help  

This mirrors the “discovery” side of the role and keeps me anchored in the user rather than just the feature.

---

### 2. Discovery Notes → Product Problem

A free text area where I can paste or write discovery notes from calls and meetings.

The app then generates a **clear, outcome-focused product problem** to work on:

> sales teams waste energy on the wrong leads and struggle to understand which opportunities are most likely to convert.

The logic is intentionally simple but demonstrates how I like to quickly move from *noise → narrative*.

---

### 3. Funnel Impact Simulator

This part is about **business impact**.

You can adjust:

- Monthly new leads  
- Baseline win rate  
- Improved win rate with better prioritisation  
- Average deal value  

The app then calculates:

- Baseline monthly revenue  
- Monthly revenue with improved focus  
- Extra revenue per month  

and plots a small comparison chart.

This shows how even a modest win rate improvement can be meaningful at scale, and connects product decisions to numbers.

---

### 4. Outcome-first Framing

A small set of bullet points that describes what “success” should look like if we ship the right prioritisation feature in Lime Go.

This is how I like to talk about features internally:
- from outcomes first  
- then behaviours  
- then specific UX ideas.

---

### 5. Initiative Prioritisation

A simple table with a few example initiatives, each with:

- user value  
- business value  
- effort  

A lightweight score is calculated and can be used to sort the table.

The idea here is not to enforce a specific framework, but to show that I think in **systems and trade-offs**, not feature wishlists.

---

### 6. Thin-slice Roadmap

An outline of how I would roll this type of capability out in phases:

1. Simple insight layer inside Lime Go  
2. Experimentation and A/B testing  
3. Playbooks and next best actions  
4. Regional tuning and advanced analytics  

This reflects the “scaleup reality” from your ad – shipping slices of value, learning, and iterating, not waiting for perfection.

---

## 🛠️ Tech

The app is intentionally lightweight so it is easy to inspect:

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** only
- One dependency: **Chart.js** from CDN for the small revenue chart
- No backend, database or build tools required  

You can open the files directly in a browser and still see the full experience.

---

## ▶️ How to run

1. Download or clone the project folder.  
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox or similar).  
3. Interact with the personas, discovery area, funnel simulator and initiative table.

No installation steps are required.

## 💬 Why this matches the Product Manager role

From the Lime Go Product Manager ad, I noted key phrases like:

- “owning product outcomes, not just shipping features”
- “identifying and prioritising meaningful product and customer problems”
- “turning ambiguous needs into clear problem statements”
- “balancing discovery and delivery”

This project is my way of showing that I am comfortable with:

- moving between **customer insight, numbers and UX**
- thinking about **systemic impact**, not isolated UI elements
- and communicating everything in a way that engineers, sales, and leadership can follow.

Thank you very much for taking the time to look at this.  
If we get the chance to talk, I would be excited to walk you through the thinking behind each section and discuss how we could apply similar approaches to real Lime Go roadmapping.

Best regards,  
**Dania**
